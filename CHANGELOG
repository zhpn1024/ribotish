2019-4-2 ribotish 0.2.2

	Python3 compatibility. Ribo-TISH can run in python 3.7.2 now.

	Readme document update

2018-9-6 ribotish 0.2.1

	Tisdiff bug fix

	Update log factorial calculation

2018-2-7 ribotish 0.2.0

	Lower the threshold between fasttest and normal test to increase testing speed.

	Some python3 compatibility updates.

2018-1-15 ribotish 0.1.11

	Update codes to allow genes with transcripts in different strands in chromosome.

	Add --blocks option to report all exon block positions for predicted ORFs.

2017-12-22 ribotish 0.1.10

	Change chisqprob to chi2.sf since chisqprob was deprecated in newer versions of scipy.

	Update NegBinom test pvalue function, more accurate and faster.

	Update GTF attribute extracting function.

	Update tisdiff R scrpts to allow non tab seperators.

	Update docs, especially for python3. Ribo-TISH codes are compatible with both python2.7 and python3.

2017-9-15 ribotish 0.1.9

	Add --colorblind option in quality to generate another color style readable for color blind people.

	Add --colors option for customizing color style.

	Some doc updates.

2017-7-28 ribotish 0.1.8

	Many updates.

	Add TIS initiation efficiency comparison in tisdiff.

	For replicate data, tisdiff still cannot deal with replicate samples, but can now export count table for replicate samples.

	Add '--chrmap' option to match different chr name versions between fasta, bam and gene annotation files. Simple conversions such as 'chr1' to '1' will be matched automatically without using this option.

	Quality can print total effective RPF counts that were assigned offset values in annotated CDS regions under -v option.

	Add R scripts for differential TIS with replicates.

	Fix error in quality using one CPU.

	Fix pth error in tisdiff.

2017-3-22 ribotish 0.1.6

	Add --inprofile option in predict. Ribotish can load transcript RPF profile from txt file generated from --transprofile option instead of bam files.

	Add --seq and --aaseq options to report ORF and peptide sequences.

	Change -a option, mainly for protein coding annotation if annotation for prediction mainly focus on non-coding RNAs.

	Move zbio library into ribotish folder.
